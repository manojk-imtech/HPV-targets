# HPVtargets

HPVtargets folder contains the data, analysis and image files used and generated in HPVs druggable target identification and drug repurposing with a focus on carcinoma.


- Candidate-targets_raw-data:- Directory contains target candidate genes associated with HPV infection from the Open Target Platforms (1520), and integration disrupted genes from HPVbase (463).

- String-PPI-Cytoscape:- Directory contains multiple files having high-confidence HPVtarget interaction network analysis (Cytoscape session (.cys)), string protein annotations, string interactions, and Cytohubba and MCODE analysis files.

- GSEA-gene_family_hallmarks:- This directory contains gene set enrichment analysis, i.e., hallmarks and families outcomes.

- Function enrichment-g-Profiler-GO-miRNAs-KEGG: This directory contains functional and pathway enrichment analysis, gene ontologies (molecular functions, biological process, cellular components), biological pathways, miRNAs, and phenotypes specific to target genes.															

- TCGA_CESC_HNSCC_data: This folder contains TCGA-CESC and HNSCC data, biospecimen, clinical annotation, frequent mutations, bar-charts, and OncoGrids. 

- Drug-target_disease_network: This directory contains drug, target, and disease data. This includes available drug candidates specific to different targets and diseases, molecule type-wise distribution of drugs with targets, molecule types with the number of drugs, and gene-wise distribution.

- Figures: This folder contains final figures associated with analysis.

- Supplementary data: This file contains 14 tables presenting all data related to analysis.
